S1000D XSL Stylesheets - README
-------------------------------

The S1000D XSL stylesheets can be used as part of a publication system to produce
page-oriented (PDF) output from S1000D conformant XML source files.

The sample directory contains a comprehensive README document (marked up with S1000D tags,
of course) that describes how to install, configure and use the stylesheets -- a ready 
formatted copy of that document can be found at:
